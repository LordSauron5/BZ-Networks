# BZ-Networks
 An e-commerce site (Completed by 28 August 2020) Individual Project:

·         BZ Networks required an online presence. I designed a minimalistic website whereby users can browse through products and make purchases (once registered).

·         Users can request a quote directly through the website and an email will be sent to the sales department.

·         The administrator can monitor all sales, services, and products from a dashboard located on the administrator’s landing page.

·         The admin can also manage all orders, products, and client information.

·         The website was constructed using vanilla PHP, small bits of JQuery, and Materialise library for JavaScript and CSS.
